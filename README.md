# NYC Taxi Data Pipeline: ETL Process

I'm taking on this project to deepen my understanding of Spark and Hadoop, especially in setting up all components seamlessly with Docker.


## 1. Dataset overview

The dataset includes yellow and green taxi trip records with details on pick-up/drop-off times and locations, trip distances, fares, rate types, payment methods, and passenger counts, provided to NYCâ€™s Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) by authorized technology providers.

## 2. Pipeline architecture
